I got some stuff running that I wrote myself, but trying to use this library knocked me out. everything I try in this for loop, fails. I do not think it is meaningful to ask for specific things, as I would just run into the next one directly. It would be nice to have an example that actually does something with the data, like store into a vec or map.\r\nEven better, a full tutorial!\r\n\r\n.. or at least pointers to code - anywhere - that uses the library.",

However, the contract of `Borrow` requires that each type that implements the `Borrow` trait has an equivalent implementation of `Hash` and `Eq` to the one of `dyn TTerm`, i.e. they must use the `term_hash()` and `term_eq()` functions. So this is not desirable for all implementors of `TTerm`.",

The drawback is that anyone requiring (even slightly) advanced SPARQL support will need to rely on implementation specific methods. But I still think that this minimal API has value for interoperability.\r\n\r\nAny comment welcome.",

    "body": "This PR aims to rework the elements of `sophia` related to the `TermFactory`.\r\n\r\nLike pointed out in #82 the current `TermFactory` trait does no longer fit into `sophia` with the `TTerm` trait. \r\n\r\nFollowing the previous discussion and inspired by [Code Smell: Concrete Abstraction](https://matklad.github.io/2020/08/15/concrete-abstraction.html) this PR removes the `TermFactory` trait completely. In turn, the existing implementations for `WeakHashSet` is turned into a concrete `TermCache` that fulfils the same task. Furthermore, the traits `FromData` and `IntoData` have been added for proper conversion between `TermData` types. This will hopefully lead to an easier `TermData` handling. As you can see the implementations of `FromData` and `IntoData` allow to pass in either owned or reference types when the function signature is something like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn foo(td: IntoData<Arc<str>>) {}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    // all works\r\n    foo(\"foo\");\r\n    foo(\"bar\".to_string());\r\n    let rc: Rc<str> = \"baz\".into();\r\n    foo(&rc);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nToDo:\r\n- [ ] Introduce `TermCache` to `IndexMap`\r\n  - While doing so #64 could be done.\r\n- [ ] Adapt the APIs of `Term`, `Iri` and similar to the new `FromData` and `IntoData` traits.",

I know that there are many projects for serializing to JSON, but getting the JSON-LD semantics correct would be extremely helpful. \r\n\r\nFrom the documentation I've looked at so far, I'm not quite sure if this project is a good choice to build on top of or not. Do you recommend looking for a different crate? Are there any hydra crates I've overlooked?",

    "body": "Today `sophia` is at an incredible state and the foundations for a powerful RDF framework for Rust are mostly done. However, while there is an increasing amount of people opening issues. The downloads of `sophia` on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/sophia) are still under a thousand. I assume we could improve the popularity and attract contributors to `sophia` or even getting people to add crates to the `sophia`-ecosystem if we promote `sophia` more in the Rust community.\r\n\r\nFor me a start would be:\r\n1. Announcement post for `sophia` v0.6 at URLO.\r\n1. Suggestion for [Crate of the Week](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/792).\r\n1. Post at [Call for Participation](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-call-for-participation/4821/323).\r\n\r\nThe later two have a chance to be included into [This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/) which is at least for me the mandatory weekly update concerning Rust.\r\n\r\nIf you wish I could write the posts I don't think this could cause any harm, just wanted to ask for permission first.",

    "body": "This PR adds a function to check whether two `Graph`s are isomorphic equivalent regarding blank nodes.\r\n\r\nSupports: #72 \r\n\r\nThis more or less resembles the algorithm used in `oxigraph` by @Tpt. However, I had to adapt it to `sophia`'s API.\r\n\r\n## The algorithm\r\n\r\nTo check if two RDF graphs are equal their triples must be compared. However, blank nodes are local to the scope of their graphs. Accordingly, the labels of blank nodes does not matter when we compare two graphs only that they refer to the same thing.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the implementation is that for each BN a distinct hash is calculated. if we do this for each BN in the two graphs a mapping from BNs of the first graph to the BNs of the second graph can be derived. If the mapping is applied to the BNs of the first graph the result should be absolute equal to the second graph.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the distinct hashes for a BN we calculate the hash of the hashes of each triple that contains the BN at any position. To eliminate the dependency from BN labels, BNs are excluded from the hashing.\r\n\r\nShould the hashes of BNs collide within a graph the hashes for those BNs are improved. This is done by hashing adjacent triples in the graph, i.e. we traverse further from subjects and objects and include the traversed triples in the hash. Iteratively the hashes are improved until no collisions are left. (In my implementation the traversal is actually limited to 8 steps). \r\n\r\n## ToDo\r\n\r\n- [x] Add more (complex) tests to verify the implementation.\r\n- [x] Implementation for datasets\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n\r\nThe code should become easier when we introduce a term-trait.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@pchampin sadly I had to add some utility function are those okay?\r\n\r\n@Tpt could you verify that my version of the algorithm is correct?",

Take a reference to a monomorphized `Term`, e.g. `Graph::triples_with_spo<'s, T, U, V>(&'s self,    s: &'s Term<T>, p: &'s Term<U>, o: &'s Term<V>) -> GTripleSource<'s, Self>`.\r\n  This version allows to directly pass references without the need to create an intermediate representation. However, this can increase compile times and code size significantly.\r\n1. Take a `RefTerm`.\r\n  This prevents monomorphization. However, it requires to build an intermediate, 76 Byte big `RefTerm`.\r\n\r\nAn alternative approach would be having a `TermTrait`, so we could pass `&dyn TermTrait` in such situations. This would prevent monomorphization and does not require an intermediate `RefTerm`. However, a definition of such a trait is still to be figured out.",

    "body": "# Topic\r\n\r\nThis issue's purpose is to discuss if it is beneficial to keep the current implementation of IRI. This discussion arose from #55.\r\n\r\n## Explanation\r\n\r\n`sophia`'s implementation of IRIs contains two elements namespace `ns` and an optional `suffix`. This means that an IRI is either represented as a whole in the namespace field or as namespace and suffix like a CURIE. This is different to other RDF libraries like [`rio`](https://docs.rs/rio_api/0.4.2/rio_api/iri/struct.Iri.html) where IRIs are always represented by a single string. The question is:\r\n\r\n**_Is it beneficial to keep the current implementation of IRIs with separated namespace and suffix?_**\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\n### Pro - less memory consumption in `Graph`s\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is beneficial when storing terms in, for example, a `Graph` with reference(-counted) `TermData` where _namespaces_ must only kept once in memory while the whole string solution would require to copy namepaces over and over again. This reduces the overall memory consumption of `sophia`.\r\n\r\n### Pro - cheap `Namespace::get()`\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation it is easy and cheap to create a `Namespace` and `get()` suffixed IRIs from it.\r\n\r\n### Con - consume more stack-memory\r\n\r\nOn the other hand keeping space for an optional `suffix` means that `sophia`'s IRIs take more stack-memory (nearly twice as much) as when the IRI would be represented in a single place. This makes it costly to create short lived references to terms like `RefTerm`.\r\n\r\n### Con - prefixes are part of syntax\r\n\r\nThe usage of prefixes/CURIEs while used in nearly all RDF serialization is part of this formats and not of actual RDF itself.\r\n\r\n### Con - resolving kills suffixes\r\n\r\nWhen a relative IRI is resolved it's suffix gets lost in the process anyway.\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\nI invite you to join the discussion. Best tag your answers with either `### Pro - ...`, `### Con - ...` or `### Conclusion - ...` and answer to particular points with `### Regarding - Pro/Con - ...`, so it's easier to keep track of pros, cons and opinions.",

    "body": "Following the discussion in #55, I realize that some people might be interested in reusing the implementation of `graph::inmem` or `dataset::inmem`, even for types that go \r\n*beyond* the RDF model (even the generalized on that Sophia supports). For example:\r\n\r\n* [Notation 3](https://www.w3.org/community/n3-dev/) (which @MattesWhite is working on)\r\n* [RDF-*](http://olafhartig.de/files/Hartig_AMW2017_RDFStar.pdf)\r\n* Other flavors of [property graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database#Labeled-property_graph)\r\n\r\nActually, these implementations are rather agnostic to the kind of *terms* they handle, as internally they are just represented by integer indexes. Possibly, this could be factored out in a separate crate (`sophia_igraph`?). And of course, if (some of) the terms they contain can be seen as RDF terms, they could in turn implement the `Graph`/`Dataset` traits...\r\n\r\n@BruJu what do you think?",

    "body": "In some situations intermediate `String`s are allocated and then transformed into `TermData`, e.g. normalization and resolving of IRIs.\r\n\r\n# Issue\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on `metis` for an example for #55. I'd like to use `CowTerm` for my parser. This means that if an absolute IRI is parsed I have `Cow::Borrowed` and I would like it to remain `Cow::Borrowed` after resolving against the base IRI. On the other hand when a relative IRI is parsed the `Cow::Borrowed` should be turned into `Cow::Owned` after resolution. This means that I have to know if a `&str` comes from the original to track lifetimes or if I get a newly allocated `String`.\r\n\r\n# Discussion of Solutions\r\n\r\n1. Change signature of `Resolve<Iri>` (and of normalization) to:\r\n    ```rust\r\n    impl<'a, 'td, TD, TD2> Resolve<Iri<TD>, Iri<TD2>> for IriParsed<'a>\r\n    where\r\n        TD: 'td + TermData,\r\n        TD2: TermData + From<&'td str> + From<String>,\r\n    { ... }\r\n    ```\r\n    This, however, prevents passing in a `TermFactory`. So maybe it would be nice to have another `Resolve`.\r\n1. Add `resolve_with()`:\r\n    ```rust\r\n    trait ResolveWith<S, STD, T = S, TTD = STD> {\r\n        fn resolve_with<'td, B, O>(&self, other: &'td S, borrowed: B, owned: O) -> T \r\n        where\r\n            STD: 'td + TermData,\r\n            B: FnMut(&'td str) -> TTD,\r\n            O: FnMut(String) -> TTD;\r\n    ```\r\n    This adds complexity and is maybe to much for the single use case of `Cow` as this is not that important for other `TermData`. Besides a default implementation:\r\n    ```rust\r\n    /// pseudo Rust\r\n    impl<'td, S, STD, T, TTD> Resolve<S, T> for ResolveWith<S, STD, T, TTD>\r\n    where\r\n        STD: 'td,\r\n        TTD: From<&'td str> + From<String>,\r\n    {\r\n        fn resolve(&self, other: &S) -> T {\r\n            self.resolve_with(other, Into::into, Into::into)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    Should be possible.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Is this case important enough to add such complexity?",

    "body": "Proposed first in #35 I suggest to introduce a trait `Term`.\r\n\r\n## Objective\r\n\r\n`sophia`'s aim is to become a central API for RDF in Rust (#23). As such it would be nice if third party terms could smoothly interoperate with `sophia`'s ecosystem, e.g. `rio`'s terms could be stored in `sophia`'s `HashGraph`, N3 terms from `metis` could use the `Serializer` interface or another crate could provide compatible, ASCII-based terms that are based on `&[u8]` (maybe even going towards `no_std`-RDF :blush:).\r\n\r\n## Required changes\r\n\r\nWith the latest effort to turn each kind of term (IRI, literal, blank node and variable) into an own type with an aligned API the step to create a trait is no longer that much work. A problem could be that this could turn advanced traits, such as `Graph`, in a mess of trait bounds. I'd like to commit a PoC-PR to see how it goes.\r\n\r\n## Suggestion\r\n\r\nHere a suggestion how a trait may look like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Term: Clone + Hash + Debug + Display \r\n    + PartialEq + PartialEq<Iri> + PartialEq<Literal> + PartialEq<BlankNode> + Eq\r\nwhere\r\n    Iri: TryFrom<Self>,\r\n    Literal: TryFrom<Self>,\r\n    BlankNode: TryFrom<Self>,\r\n{\r\n    type TermData: TermData;\r\n\r\n    fn value(&self) -> String;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe focus should be to keep the `Term` trait as small as possible while other behaviour is kept separate in other traits, e.g. `Resolve`.\r\n",

Both together would result in `conflicting implementation`.\r\n1. **Splitted implementations violate privacy bounds.** Declaring a `struct` in `crate::triple::stream` and implementing `QuadSource` in `crate::quad::stream` requires the fields to be `pub(crate)` at least.\r\n\r\n# Solutions\r\n\r\n**For 1.:** Maybe some overall abstraction for statements?\r\n\r\n**For 2.:** Merge the `stream` submodules into a top-level module `stream` equal to `triple` and `quad`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This would allow for this kind of pattern:\r\n```\r\nlet base = some_iri_term.to_base();\r\nlet abs_triples = some_triple_source.map_triples(|t| base.join_triple(&t));\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Beyond the parsed triples/quads, parsers may collect additional useful information, for example prefix declarations or base IRI. What would be the best API to get this information?\r\n\r\nMy initial idea was to add methods to the triple/quad source returned by the `parse` methods, to access this information. For example:\r\n```rust\r\n    let parsed_triples = sophia::parser::turtle::parse_bufread(ttl_file)?;\r\n    my_graph.insert_all(&mut parsed_triples);\r\n    let prefix_map = triples.get_prefix_map();\r\n```\r\nThe drawback of this approach is that it forces us to keep the triple source, even when it is exhausted. Method such as `Graph::insert_all` can not consume it, they have to borrow it mutably (which is rather counter intuitive).\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to use a kind of callback:\r\n```rust\r\n    let parsed_triples = sophia::parser::turtle::parse_bufread(ttl_file)?;\r\n    let mut prefix_map = HashMap::new();\r\n    parsed_triples.on_prefix(|prefix, iri| prefix_map.insert(prefix, iri));\r\n    my_graph.insert_all(parsed_triples);\r\n```\r\nThis approach might be slightly harder to implement, but offers more flexibility. And it makes it possible to consume sources while still getting the additional information.\r\n\r\n@Tpt @MattesWhite  any thought?",

    "body": "For now `sophia` only provides serializers for `N-Triples` and `N-Quads`. In order to support further serializers, we must develop an API for them, i.e. traits and some utilities. This contributes to #23.\r\n\r\n_When ever triples and graphs are mentioned those can be replaced by quad and dataset respectively. If not mentioned otherwise._\r\n\r\n## Steps towards an improved serializer API\r\n\r\n- [X] Make the internals of `Term::Literal` an own type like `IriData` or `BNodeId`. This way it is easier to implement specific serializations for literals.\r\n- [x] Remove the `n3()`-method from `Term`. It can be replaced by introducing a trait, e.g.:\r\n\r\n  ```rust\r\n  trait NtSerializableTerm {\r\n      fn nt(&self) -> String;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  impl NtSerializableTerm for Term {\r\n      fn nt(&self) -> String {\r\n          crate::serializer::nt::stringify_term(self)\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Or at least rename the method properly.\r\n- [x] Provide a trait `Serializer` or several specific one, e.g. `TripleSerializer` and `GraphSerializer`. The first for streams the second for more sophisticated actions (see #17). Some symmetry to the `Parser` trait would be nice.\r\n- [x] Introduce the changes to the NT-serializer.\r\n\r\nAll points are open to discussion.",

    "body": "This PR changes the error-handling of sophia and some semantics of `XSource` and `XSink` traits.\r\nI know, I shouldn't do two different things in one PR but I couldn't resist ... \r\n\r\n# Change in error-handling\r\n\r\nThis PR canges the error-handling in `sophia` from `error-chain` and `coercible-errors` to `thiserror` and `anyhow`.\r\n\r\n## Specific errors\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #8 is the `error-chain`-crate somewhat outdated. I choose the relatively new `thiserror` as it is very simple and easy to use. \r\nIn addition the big `sophia::error::Error` is split into module-errors as suggested by [`snafu`](https://docs.rs/snafu/0.6.0/snafu/guide/philosophy/index.html#many-error-types). This will make it easier to split up `sophia` (#26) and reduces dependencies between the modules. Furthermore, it is someaht more aligned with the philosophie of \"each implementation can provide its own error\".\r\n\r\n## Coliding error-types\r\n\r\nThis was handled by `coercible-errors` before and is changed to `anyhow`. It provides [`anyhow::Error`](https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.25/anyhow/struct.Error.html) which is \"a better `Box<dyn Error>`\". It can be created from anytype that implements `std::error::Error`, therefore, is suitable when different error-types colide.\r\n\r\nAs stated in `anyhow`'s [docs](https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.25/anyhow/index.html#details) can `anyhow::Error` be downcasted to a concrete error-type, so users can still match against concrete types, e.g. done in the parser test.\r\n\r\nI don't want to offend `coercible-errors`. I just think the handling of many different errors will become more and more complicated as the `sophia`-ecosystem grows as implementers probably provide their own error-types. The complexity has been presented at `graph::Graph::retain()` which had a bizzar and complicated trait bound and now just returns `anyhow::Error`.\r\n\r\nThe merge-everything `anyhow::Error` is only used when two or more errors are used within one function. Everything else returns a specific error-type. This highlights better where the user has to be aware of error-mixing.\r\n\r\n# Semantics of `Iterator`s\r\n\r\n_When \"Triples\" are mentioned in the following section they can always be substituted with \"Quads\"_\r\n\r\nThe semantics of `TripleSource` and `TripleSink` always felt a bit cumbersome to me. As a result, I changed the semantics of them a bit.\r\n\r\n## Consume sources\r\n\r\nOften `Iterator`s where past in by `&mut` but `Iterator`s are designed to be consumed by iteration, therefore, it is more idomatic to move them into a function. Accordingly, I added `TripleSink::feed_all()` method that takes a `TripleSource`.\r\n\r\nThe semantic of a `TripleSink` is also not totaly clear to me. On the one hand there is the 'serializer'-sink that consumes and finishes just like `TripleSource`'s API suggests. On the other hand there are 'graph'-sinks that consume triples as-well but finishing them seems a bit unnatural. As a consequence, I removed the `Graph::inserter` and `Graph::remover` methods which are equally substituted by `Graph::insert_all` and `Graph::remove_all`.\r\n\r\n## Create from TripleSource\r\n\r\nThe builder-pattern for graphs seemed a bit unidomatic for me. Consequently, I removed `in_sink` and `in_graph` methods and created the new `CollectToGraph`-trait which extends the standard `Iterator`. I think this is more accesible for Rust programmers as its more close to the standard API (cf. getting started example in `lib.rs`). I tried to implement something like `impl FromIterator for Result<Graph>` so user could just call `collect()?` on a `TripleSource` but this is vorbidden by Rust's orphan rule...\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nI'm totally aware that these are huge changes and that you might think that some of them are to much. Most of the changes I did are for sake of better ergonomics and a more idomatic Rust. I am open to disucussion and l will gladly change the PR if required.\r\n",

According to the [RDF Concepts and Abstract Syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/), language tags are defined in [BCP47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47), which states:\r\n> All comparisons MUST be performed in a case-insensitive manner.\r\n\r\nThis can be found in the W3C RDF/XML syntax examples: [`example08.rdf`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-syntax-grammar-20040210/example08.rdf) has `en-US`  while [`example08.nt`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-rdf-syntax-grammar-20040210/example08.nt) has `en-us` where both are supposed to be equal.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes `PartialEq`, but also `Hash`, to make comparison and hashing of `LiteralKind` case-insensitive. (*About the `to_lowercase` call: this one allocates, while it could be possible to loop over all characters of the `tag1` and hash their lowercase variant without allocating, but since language tags are extremely small strings I am not sure this would really be an improvement over allocating and hashing the buffered bytes directly).",

    "body": "Hi,\r\nI'm using this crate a lot for an IoT application and realy like it. However, I run into problems when iterating a Graph.\r\n\r\nThe core idea I want to accomplish is to build structs from the contents of a Graph. Therefore I defined following trait:\r\n````rust\r\npub trait FromGraph<'a, T, G>: Sized\r\nwhere\r\n    T: Borrow<str>,\r\n    G: Graph<'a>,\r\n    MyError: From<<G as Graph<'a>>::Error>,\r\n{\r\n    fn from_graph(s: &'a Term<T>, graph: &'a G) -> MyResult<Self>;\r\n}\r\n````\r\nThis works fine until I want to parse nested Structs, e.g. I have the following graph:\r\n````\r\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/...#> .\r\n@base <http://example.org/> .\r\n\r\nEntityA a A ;\r\n  rdf:value 42 .\r\nEntityB a B ;\r\n  hasA EntityA ;\r\n  rdf:value 24 .\r\n````\r\nTo use those in my code I've written the following in-Rust-representation:\r\n````rust\r\nlazy_static! {\r\n    static ref HAS_A: Term<&'static str> = unsafe{ Term::new_iri_unchecked(\"http://example.org/hasA\", Some(true)) };\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]\r\nstruct A {\r\n    value: i32,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<'a, T, G> FromGraph<'a, T, G> for A\r\nwhere\r\n    T: Borrow<str>,\r\n    G: Graph<'a>,\r\n    MyError: From<<G as Graph<'a>>::Error>,\r\n{\r\n    fn from_graph(s: &'a Term<T>, graph: &'a G) -> MyResult<Self> {\r\n        let t_value = graph.iter_for_sp(s, &rdf::value).last().ok_or(MyError)??;\r\n        let t_value = t_value.o();\r\n        let value = t_value.value().parse::<i32>()?;\r\n        Ok(A { value })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]\r\nstruct B {\r\n    a: A,\r\n    value: i32,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl<'a, T, G> FromGraph<'a, T, G> for B\r\nwhere\r\n    T: Borrow<str>,\r\n    G: Graph<'a>,\r\n    MyError: From<<G as Graph<'a>>::Error>,\r\n{\r\n    fn from_graph(s: &'a Term<T>, graph: &'a G) -> MyResult<Self> {\r\n        let t_a = graph.iter_for_sp(s, &HAS_A).last().ok_or(MyError)??;\r\n        let t_a = t_a.o(); // here is where the error occures\r\n        let a = A::from_graph(t_a, graph)?;\r\n\r\n        let t_value = graph.iter_for_sp(s, &rdf::value).last().ok_or(MyError)??;\r\n        let t_value = t_value.o();\r\n        let value = t_value.value().parse::<i32>()?;\r\n        Ok(B { a, value })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````\r\nThe error I get is `t_a does not live long enough`\r\n````\r\n   |\r\n64 | impl<'a, T, G> FromGraph<'a, T, G> for B\r\n   |      -- lifetime `'a` defined here\r\n...\r\n72 |         let t_a = t_a.o(); // here is where the error occures\r\n   |                   ^^^----\r\n   |                   |\r\n   |                   borrowed value does not live long enough\r\n   |                   argument requires that `t_a` is borrowed for `'a`\r\n...\r\n79 |     }\r\n   |     - `t_a` dropped here while still borrowed\r\n````\r\nDo you have any idea how I could get this working? Maybe an API change could solve this?\r\n\r\nIn the end I want to accomplish something serde-flavored like:\r\n````rust\r\n#[derive(FromGraph)]\r\nstruct A {\r\n  #[predicate(rdf:value)]\r\n  value: i32,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(FromGraph)]\r\nstruct B {\r\n  #[predicate(HAS_A)]\r\n  a: A,\r\n  #[predicate(rdf:value)]\r\n  value: i32,\r\n}\r\n````",

    "body": "Problem\r\n----\r\n\r\nCurrently, when inserting bnode identifies in a graph, the bnode identifier is kept as is.\r\n\r\nFor example, loading this file into a graph:\r\n```\r\n_:b1 <tag:p> \"foo\".\r\n```\r\nthen, loading this file into the same graph:\r\n```\r\n_:b1 <tag:q> \"bar\".\r\n```\r\nwill result in the following graph (in Turtle):\r\n```\r\n  [] <tag:p> \"foo\"; <tag:q> \"bar\".\r\n```\r\nwhile it should be\r\n```\r\n  [] <tag:p> \"foo\".\r\n  [] <tag:q> \"bar\".\r\n```\r\n*i.e.* two different subjects, because the bnode identifiers in the two different files have two different scopes.\r\n\r\nNB: it is important for the developer to be able to handle bnodes consistently, so at the lowest level (e.g. `Graph::insert`), the API should consider bnode identifiers as stable. But on the other hand, the default behaviour when loading a file should be the correct one.\r\n\r\nProposed solution\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe methods `TripleSource.in_graph` and `QuadSource.in_dataset` are the preferred way of loading a stream of triples/quads (such as the one coming from a parser) into a graph/dataset. \r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to change the semantics of these methods, and make them rename the bnodes they receive to avoid name-clashes with existing bnodes in the graph/dataset. Whether this should be done by generating UUIDs or inspecting the target graph/dataset for existing name, I'm not sure yet...\r\n\r\nNew methods `in_graph_raw` and `in_dataset_raw` (better name?) should probably be added, which would have the current semantics of `in_graph` and `in_dataset`.",

A solution would be to separate the trait `Triple<'a>` into the term-owning `Triple<T: TermData>` and the term-borrowing `TripleRef<'a, T: TermData>`. As a result the lifetime of `Graph<'a>` could be removed, so `triples(&'a self) -> GTripleSource<'a>` could be rewritten to (pseudocode) `triples<'a>(&'a self) -> Iterator<Item = TripleRef<'a, T>>`.\r\nI'll try this solution myself and write a PR if I'm successful.\r\n\r\nBTW: I would introduce the super-trait `TermData` for convienence:\r\n````rust\r\n/// Supertrait for all properties data of a `Term<T>` must provide.\r\npub trait TermData: AsRef<str> + Clone + Eq + Hash {}\r\nimpl<T> TermData for T where T: AsRef<str> + Clone + Eq + Hash {}\r\n````",

Please be aware, though, that the API is still very unstable at the moment (but I guess you figured that, given the early stage of the project).\r\n\r\nThe lifetimes with `Term`, `Triple` and `Graph` are a mess. The ideal solution would be that graph use a Generic Associated Type instead of having the lifetime \"fixed\" in its own type parameters, but GTAs are not available in Rust yet -- although I heard that they might land during 2019...\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I came up with this design, but it has some drawbacks, as you painfully discovered. I'm very interested in your solution. I'll have a look at it myself, but any PR would be more than welcome.",

    "body": "Ok, I have a working version of your example, in the [dedicated branch](https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs/tree/issue5) I just pushed.\r\n\r\nThe solution relies on [Higher-Rank Trait Bounds](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/hrtb.html), which I already had to use in some parts of the crate. This is not ideal, because it is a relatively advanced and complex feature of Rust (it is only documented in the Nomicon, AFAIK), and at the time, I hoped that users of the crate would not need to be exposed to them, but your example proves me wrong on that part.\r\n\r\nSo this way of using `Graph` in trait bounds should be thoroughly documented, and possibly eased by creating trait aliases (such as the one you suggest for `TermData`). Although not ideal, it is the only way I found to provide the level of genericity that I want to achieve. Your proposal is interesting, but I don't want to force `Graph` implementations to yield `TripleRef`s, some implementations may create triples on demand and \"give them away\".\r\n\r\nAs I mentionned earlier, the ideal solution would be to have [Generic Associated Types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1598-generic_associated_types.md), so the API may get simpler when (if?) they get included in Rust.",

    "body": "Thank you for your efforts and indeed that solves my concrete problem.\r\n\r\nHowever, I still think that the trait interface of `Graph<'a>` including a lilfetime implies wrong semantics. Because the lifetime is associated with triples returned from the `Graph` not to `Term`s that are actually stored in the `Graph` itself.\r\nI finally found a solution that is, in my opinion, clearer about lifetimes. The most important changes are:\r\n```rust\r\npub trait Graph {\r\n    type TermData: TermData;\r\n    type Error: CoercibleWith<Error> + CoercibleWith<Never>;\r\n\r\n    fn triples<'a>(&'a self) -> GTripleSource<'a, Self>;\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\npub type GResult<G, T> = std::result::Result<T, <G as Graph>::Error>;\r\npub type GTripleSource<'a, G> = Box<dyn Iterator<Item = GResult<G, RefTriple<'a, <G as Graph>::TermData>>>>;\r\npub type RefTriple<'a, T> = [&'a Term<T>; 3];\r\n```\r\nThis removes the lifetimes of Graph and Triple while the iterators hold a correct lifetime which is directly associated to the call to `triples()`. As mentioned before I'm working on refactoring the whole library but as this is a major change it takes some time.\r\nI know this approach is contrary to your approach having the `Graph` as generic as possible because the returned triples are now fixed to `RefTriple<'a, T>`. As long as there are no GATs I think this is the best solution. \r\nInvestigating the `Graph`'s implementations I only found triples of `RefTriple<'a, T>` build and returned in the triple-iterators. I think that is fine as there are only the costs for contructing the `Triple`s that way.\r\n\r\nAs I understand a destinction between a `TripleSource` of `Triple`s that own their `Term`s for consumption and a `TripleSource` of `Triple`s that only borrow their `Term`s for inspecting a `Graph`'s contents could be benefitial. For example something like:\r\n````rust\r\ntrait TripleSource {\r\n  type Triple: Triple + 'static;\r\n  type Error: ...;\r\n  type Iter: Iterator<Item = Result<Self::Triple, Self::Error>>;\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// pseudo code\r\ntrait GTriples<'a, G> {\r\n  type Iter: Iterator<Item = GResult<G, RefTriple<'a, <G as Graph>::TermData>>>;\r\n\r\n  fn into_triple_source(self) -> impl TripleSource {\r\n    self.map(|[s, p, o]| { [s.clone(), p.clone(), o.clone()] })\r\n  } \r\n}\r\n````",

    "body": "Regarding graphs returning `RefTriples`: this will be a problem as soon as we add file-backed or database-backed implementations of `Graph`, where the triples will not be permanently stored in memory.\r\n\r\nThe lifetime parameter of `Graph` it is the lifetime for which the graph can be borrowed for iterating over triples -- and indirectly, it also constraints the lifetime of the terms of the graph. I agree that it is confusing, but not necessarily \"wrong\", as long as we make things really clearer. I pushed to the branche `issue5` a proposal for documenting this, as well as trait aliases to make it easier to use. In practice, the trait `OwnedGraph` would be used instead of the trait `Graph` in type bounds, and would provide roughly the same ergonomics as your proposal, without sacrificing genericity.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thank you for this suggestion. I need more input before I make a decision.\r\n\r\nYou argue that `error-chain` [is not maintained anymore](rust-lang-nursery/failure#181), however the conclusion of the thread you cite is [not as clear-cut](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure/issues/181#issuecomment-421734025). Furthermore, it seems that `error-chain` [is still being maintained](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/error-chain/commits/master) after all.\r\n\r\nThat being said, after a quick glance at `failure`, I must say it does look more elegant and lightweight than `error-chain` (I'm not a big fan of the `Error`/`ErrorKind` dichotomy... it feels like coding in Java :smiling_imp:).\r\n\r\nStill, I'm a bit uncomfortable with investing in a crate whose ambition is to deprecate a trait from the standard lib. Especially when some of the complains about the standard trait have been fixed in the meantime. In that respect, the [Evolution section in their README](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/failure#evolution) is not really clear, but it makes me nervous.\r\n\r\nSo, could you please elaborate more why you think `failure` is a safer bet for the future than `error-chain`?",

It is unclear how to do that with `error-chain`, since I'm not sure you can both expose an error as an attribute *and* access it through the backtrace.\r\n\r\nThe other advantage is that the conversion traits make it easier to use `?`, whereas `error-chain` sometimes require you to wrap/convert the error yourself (see the PR for the XML parser, where implementing another error category makes it more verbose to return a top-level error from the lower-level one).",

But in the case of `ParseError`, I wouldn't have wanted to fix in advance the type of error that can be its cause (because different parsers will have different underlying errors, your XML parser is a perfect example). So if I had had to define a member for the chained error, its type would have been `Box<std::error::Error>`, and it would still have required downcasting.\r\n\r\n> Ultimately, both libraries are doing the same thing\r\n\r\nYes, but `failure` is doing it its own specific way, while `error-chain` is playing ball with the standard `Error` trait...\r\n\r\nI agree that `error-chain` is generally more verbose, but it still looks like a safer choice.

    "body": "## Proposed solution (revamped)\r\n\r\nThinking about it a little more, I think that the right place to fix this is in [`graph::Inserter`](https://docs.rs/sophia/0.3.0/sophia/graph/struct.Inserter.html) and [`dataset::Inserter`](https://docs.rs/sophia/0.3.0/sophia/dataset/struct.Inserter.html) respectively.\r\n\r\nThere should actually be two implementations for each, `RawInserter` (current implementation) and `ScopedInserter` (which ensures that all blank nodes passed to the inserter will be created as fresh blank nodes, renaming them if needed). The methods `Graph::inserter` and `Dataset::inserter` should also be replaced accordingly by methods named `raw_inserter` and `scoped_inserter`.\r\n\r\nThe `in_graph`/`in_dataset` methods of sinks would use scoped inserters (as this is the most common use case). And I don't think (anymore) that a `*_raw` variant of these methods is required. If someone really wants to do that, they can still write:\r\n```\r\n    let inserted = my_source.in_sink(&mut my_graph.raw_inserter());\r\n```",

    "body": "That would be great to make Sophia works with Oxigraph storage! The Oxigraph RockDB layout is not stable yet, I am currently tweaking it to make it a bit more compact and allow efficient range queries. I hope to have time finishing a 0.1 Oxigraph release with a stable RocksDB layout in late December or (more realistically) January.\r\n\r\nThe basic storage approach should not change: I store in RocksDB keys rotations of quads of [`EncodedTerm`](https://github.com/Tpt/oxigraph/blob/e0bbe29dc2377fc1277d4c232c9c26c90bd13551/lib/src/store/numeric_encoder.rs#L93) and a string store. RocksDB prefix searches are then used to solve triple patterns. The string store is used as an inverse hash lookup, the strings being hashed inside of `EncodedTerm`. Hashing strings is very useful for heavy SPARQL query evaluations with a lot of joins, it might not be the best approach for just storing and doing simple triple pattern evaluation.\r\n\r\nBut, I'm not sure that reimplementing Oxigraph storage in Sophia is the best way to do it. I fear than very quickly you might want also to be able to run SPARQL queries on top of it in Sophia, completely duplicating the work already done in Oxigraph. A better way to go would probably to make Oxigraph usable with Sophia.",

    "body": "> Are there any design choices in Sophia's traits or underlying types which you find too opinionated or constraining?\r\n\r\nI would actually disagree with the goal of this question. I find a lot of Sophia traits not opinionated enough, having a lot of generic arguments making their use very cumbersome. Imho RDF libraries end users should not have to write any `for<'a>` or similar syntaxes like Sophia documentation suggests. Performance is good, making the library more complex to use to earn  1 extra percent is probably not worth it.\r\n\r\nI do not argue that we should end up with something like the small [model library of Oxigraph](https://github.com/Tpt/oxigraph/tree/master/lib/src/model) that is too opinionated and requires to many memory copies. An easy to use and to integrate middle ground is what we need.\r\n\r\nWe should maybe have a look at successful libraries like [http](https://crates.io/crates/http/) or [url](https://crates.io/crates/url/) that are used in a lot of very different places while keeping what I think is a fairly simple API.",

    "body": "When talking about error-handling, what about the `coercible_error`.\r\n\r\nI can definetly see its use-case and the performance it could bring and I can understand that you want to use it as it was probably your first crate in Rust. But, it feels very unergonomic and produces a lot of noise. In addition, I think its performance boost is not as much as one might guess.\r\n\r\nA correctly designed error-enum should have not more than 24 bytes (two pointers and an extra 64 bit field on a 64-bit-machine). This shouldn't affect the overall memory requirement of an RDF-application.\r\n\r\nIn order to handle errors in an public API, it is totally okay to go with `Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync>` in my opinion. The improvements of the `std::error::Error`-trait allow downcasting it. In addition, a `Box` has only a size of 8 bytes.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be using an own error-enum like:\r\n```Rust\r\nuse thiserror:Error as ThisError;\r\n\r\n#[derive(ThisError, Debug)]\r\nenum Error {\r\n    ... ,\r\n    #[error(External Error: {0})]\r\n    FromExtern(String),\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Error {\r\n    from_external<E: std::error::Error>(e: E) -> Self {\r\n        Error::FromExternal(e.to_string())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis way every implementor of a custom graph, parser, etc. could `impl From<ExternalError> for Error` easily.",

    "body": "+1 for the separation of Sophia.\r\n\r\nBut, before going into that direction, we probably need to make an ecosystem choice. Do we want to have big integrated libraries like what exists in Java with Jena and RDF4J that does most of the things but are hardly interoperable between each other or do we want to have API crates providing  common interfaces and then have an ecosystem of libraries implementing them like what exists now in JavaScript with the RDF/JS community group work.\r\n\r\nI would be more inclined to prefer the second option that would then see the existence of different implementations targetting different use cases and able to work with each other. We could have an integrated toolkit (sophia), a quad store targetting performance (Oxigraph), a parser suite (Rio), a json-ld implementation... all able to be able to be used with each other.\r\n\r\nIf we go into the \"Sophia is the foundation\" direction, I am a bit concern with the choice of the CECILL-C license. The rust compiler currently statically link crates together, making the CECILL-C license viral if I understand it correctly. It might prevent reuse by for profit organizations, reducing significantly the reach of the library.",

Initially, I wanted to define a `Parser` trait, but was unabled to complete it and opted instead for the \"abstract interface\" + macros approach, but I am not entierly satisfied with it. So thanks for prompting me, I'll give it a try again.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the trait vs. macro problem, what you propose above is actually very close to the current API, expect that what you call `Parser` is currently called `Config`. And this was a deliberate choice, because the actual *parser*, in my view, is only created when you call `parse_str` or `parse_read`. You mention \"storing state so they can lazily parse\" (which I think is what current implementations are doing), but such state (e.g. prefix bindings in Turtle) should not be shared across multiple calls of `parse_X`. The only thing that is really persistent here is, therefore, the parsing *configuration*, hence the current name.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I agree that this subtle semantic distinctions may bring more confusion than clarity. So we might as well bite the bullet and use the name everyone expects.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up: my plan is to replace the current `Config` \"protocol\" by a `Parser` trait, offering roughly the same interface.",

    "body": "As I still agree that my PR #27 was not good, I still use it as a proof of concept.\r\n\r\n## Cons of the current error handling\r\n\r\nThe main point I wanted to lay out was the seperation of errors. Instead of having one big `sophia::Error`, I support the idea of smaller errors. This allows for an easier integration of 'external' errors. \r\n\r\nAs laid out in #26 the plan is to build an ecosystem of crates that implement against `sophia-core`'s API. This means that there will probably be implementations we don't think of now that can and will fail in different ways. Consequently, `sophia` is required to allow and handle the integration of 'external' error-types.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of `coercible-errors` is to force implementors to use a provided error-type (correct my if I got that wrong). The problem is that this provided error probably will not be sufficient for all use cases, as pointed out above. As a result, I think that `coercible-error` is not a suitable error-handling-strategy for the future 'center of the ecosystem' `sophia-core`.\r\n\r\n## Pros presented in #27\r\n\r\nIn difference, I showed an implementation of sophia with the rather new crates [`anyhow`](https://crates.io/crates/anyhow) and [`thiserror`](https://crates.io/crates/thiserror) ( see #27 ).\r\n\r\n`thiserror` is only used to build the module-own error-types. It was designed specific for this and is easy to use.\r\n\r\nThe `anyhow::Error` is a [\"better `Box<dyn Error + Send + Sync + `'static>`\"](https://docs.rs/anyhow/1.0.25/anyhow/struct.Error.html). It should only be used when different error-types could colide, e.g. when building a `Graph` from an `TriplesSource` which both can fail. In every other case a specific error should be returned.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, users will know which errors colide (\"I use the `TripleSource` from `NtParser` to build a `HashGraph`, accordingly the error is either `ParserError` or `HashGraphError`\"). Therefore, it should be possible for users to figure out which concrete error-types they can expect when they receive an `anyhow::Error`.\r\n\r\nAnother point is the weight of zero-cost error-handling. While it is true that `coercible-errors` allow to use zero-sized errors, the effect is mitigated due to the size of `anyhow::Error` as it is only a narrow-pointer, i.e. the size of a word.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that in some cases `coercible-errors` saves memory this benfit is mitigated by the good implementation of `anyhow`. Instead, an implementation with module-own error-types and `anyhow` allows a lot more easy integration of 'external' error-types into the `sophia`-ecosystem. Besides, with the soon [stabilization of the `never`-type](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/65355) the compiler will become better at handling infallible operations by itself.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion about that? I would be glad if we could continue this discussion. If we can agree on an implementation I will gladly submit a PR.",

And indeed, this is incompatible with `coercible-error`'s philosopy. +1 on getting rid of it.\r\n\r\nI had a look at `thiserror` and I like it very much. +1 on using it.\r\n\r\nI have more doubts about `anyhow`, though. It is explicitly targeted at *applications*, as opposed to *libraries*, and `sophia` is the latter. I have a counter proposal below.\r\n\r\n## Alternative to `anyhow` or `Box<dyn Error>`\r\n\r\nThe only place (I think) where we would need such a \"generic\" errors it is with (triple or quad) streams. The source and the sink can each have their own error type, and so the operation should be able to return one or the other.\r\n\r\nI suggest we introduce (in the `triple::stream` module) the following type (with the appropriate `thiserror`  annotations)\r\n```rust\r\nenum StreamError<E1, E2> {\r\n  UpStream{ source: E1 },\r\n  DownStream{ source: E2 },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems to me that this type has the best of both worlds from `coercible-error` and `anyhow`:\r\n\r\n* it takes 0 bytes if E1 and E2 are both impossible types,\r\n* its `source` method will always return a `dyn Error` which can be dynamically downcast,\r\n* bonus: it can also be statically downcast with a simple `match`...\r\n\r\nGranted, the return type of stream methods (such as `in_sink` and `in_graph`) will be slightly more verbose than with `anyhow`, but at least it is (I think) idiomatic and easily understandable.",

    "body": "Removing lifetimes on Tripe and Quad is easy. I have a local branch that I'll push soon, where this is done.\r\n\r\nFor Graph and Dataset, this is more tricky. The problem comes from the fact that Graph::Triple, which is the type returned by the iterating methods (triples, triples_with_s, etc.) sometimes needs a lifetime, especially when one wants the iterator to return *references* to internal triples owned by the graph. This is something that I would like to keep.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned [elsewhere](https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs/issues/23#issuecomment-563998845_), the cleanest solution would be generic associated types (GAT), but those are not expected to be stabilized before long...\r\n\r\nI have experimented with another approach, which tries to emulate somehow GAT, by using pointers under the hood, hence eschewing lifetime parameters, and wrapping them in a safe abstraction. I tried my best to make this approach easy enough for implementors of the Graph trait (although the documentations is still rough at the edges).\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/pchampin/7fbf3262ab22b6a0f6a6eae8a6aa938c\r\n\r\n@Tpt @MattesWhite anyonelse... your feedback would be much appreciated",

If we also make the subject, predicate and object explicit, we would have a type `Triple` that would be an owned only triple, and `TripleCow` that is `Cow` for triples (and maybe `TripleRef` for the cases where just references are enough)?

    "body": "> Your solution seems suitable.\r\n\r\nCool :)\r\n\r\n> * One minor disadvantage I see is the cost of extra wrapping of newly created triple but maybe the compiler is smart enough to optimize that away.\r\n\r\nMy solution has zero overhead in memory (PhantomData is 0-sized) and in runtime (provided the appropriate `#[inline]` annotations). Yours (with an enum) does induce an overhead. More below.\r\n\r\n> * What definitley must be document is that this is just a temporary solution until GATs arrive.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I wouldn't hold my breath, though... GATs have been mentioned for a while now.\r\n\r\n> * A small suggestion I have to make: When implementors see that they have to return `GuradedTriples` they will probably have first a look at the docs of the type. As a consequence, I would move the constructors to the type itself.\r\n\r\nVery good point. The current approach (with method) evolved organically from previous attempts, but the constructor approach is much cleaner.\r\n\r\n> * Your implementation exposes the raw pointers to the user/implementor. [Here](https://gist.github.com/MattesWhite/f5daf2d38d36c4e325e00cbb41ec59e8) is a version with a complete safe API and without `UnsafeTriple`.\r\n\r\nActually, the raw pointers are hidden inside the GuardedTriple; neither implementors nor users will actually *handle* the pointers directly. Only a very daring implementor may have to write `unsafe` sections if they are not satisfied with the 3 provided options, and decide to add their own implementation of UnsafeTriple. Which the documentation will clearly discourage.\r\n\r\nNow, regarding your variant: by using enums, you are introducing memory overhead (the enum takes as much space as the biggest variant), and runtime overhead (each call to triple methods will go through the `match` statement). My approach relies on [monomorphisation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-01-syntax.html#performance-of-code-using-generics).\r\n\r\nIf we were to accept a small overhead, there would be no need for this complex approach. We could simply go for dynamic dispatching with trait objects:\r\n```rust\r\ntrait Graph {\r\n    // note that the associated type Triple has vanished\r\n\r\n    fn triple<'s>(&'s self) -> Box<dyn Iterator<Item=Box<dyn Triple + 's>> + 's>\r\n    //                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n    //                                               this is the big change\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have considered this option. But, as I expressed before, I find it sad to renounce zero-cost abstract so close to the goal. And the proposed approach will allow for a smooth transition when GAT finally land (basically replace the associated type `Triple = *const T` with `Triple<'t> = &'t T`). So I think it is worth the (temporary and relatively light) hassle.\r\n\r\n(sorry for the long answer)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The discussions about #8 may have impact on this issue. We actually have two options:\r\n\r\n1. define a dedicated `sophia::parser::Error` which would replace the `ParserError` variant of the current global error type (with its location attribute to know where the error happened), or\r\n2. let each parser have their own error type, exposed through an associated type, just like `Graph` and `Dataset`.\r\n\r\nThe second option is more light-weight, but then we lose the ability to uniformly get the location of the error. This could be mitigated by requiring `Parser::Error` to implement a `WithLocation` trait that would be defined in the `parser` module...\r\n\r\nI think I like option 2 + `WithLocation` trait better.

    "body": "Nice work this should satisfy the most use cases.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that bothers me is the `WithLocation`-trait. I'm not sure if it is realy needed. All relevant parsers I know (`nom`, `pest`, `rio`) provide their own way of specifing location of an error. Each way differs somewhat but they are part of an error type **and** their textual representation. \r\nIn addition, I think the information is only relevant for RDF that is written by hand. RDF that was created by a seriallizer shouldn't contain formal errors and implementing a serializer that corrects its serialization based on errors from a parser seems not to be realistic. In fact, the only one that benefits from locating an error are humans. As a result, there is no need to include `Location` as part of the parser-api as a good parser will include it anyway.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to removing `WithLocation` would be to introduce something like `DisplayWithSource` which would print return a pretty print of the wrong area with further information (cf the [`chic`](https://docs.rs/chic/1.2.2/chic/)-crate) (kinda the `rustc` error messages). However, this is only realy applicable for `String`-based parsers.",

    "body": "To be honest, there are about 50 lines of code dedicated to the Turtle formatter with no signs of prefixes, abbreviated numerical literals, nested anonymous blank nodes and so on. Basically the formatter is not existent. Furthermore, `rio` itself lacks a `Graph` which is necessary at least to print nested blank nodes [[Jena doc](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/io/rdf-output.html#streamed-block-formats)]. In addition `rio` itself is labeled as\r\n\r\n> RDF parsers library \r\n\r\nSo I think there won't be any progress in the near future. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the best solution is to write a serializer specifically for the `sophia-core` API. At least to provide a basic serializer that is not NTriples.\r\n\r\nFor me the lack of a practical serializer is a blocking issue for the adoption of Rust in the Semantic Web. Therefore, the Turtle serializer has the highest priority for me and I wouldn't mind contributing the first external crate to `sophia`'s ecosystem (after we're done refactoring the error-handling).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@Tpt What do you have to say about this topic and my estimations?",

    "body": "Indeed, the current Rio formatters are very basic. I wrote them in a few hours to have something working for Oxigraph. I did not put much effort into them.\r\n\r\nOne of my dream for Rio would be to add a second parser/formatter API additionally to the current triples/quads iterations that would encodes the syntax level structures like prefixes used, nested blank nodes, RDF lists... This would allow to convert between RDF representations while keeping as much structure as possible and allow Rio users to control how the content is rendered. This API would probably look like a stream of event like \"open nested blank node\", \"add predicate\" \"add subject\" \"close predicate\", \"open list\"...  But I do not think I'll work on it anytime soon. I am trying to push a first working version of Oxigraph at the moment.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to have now a Turtle formatter highly integrated with what Sophia is currently offering I believe that writing a Turtle formatter inside of Sophia makes a lot of sense.",

    "body": "Thanks @Tpt for this answer. I guess we can give it a try inside Sophia first, and possibly port it to Rio if you like it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure we need something as sophisticated as the events you suggest. The way I see it, a Turtle serializer would be initialized with a base and a set of prefixes, and would then receive a stream of triples. It would serializer the triples in order, doing its best to keep it compact (using base, prefixes, and subject/predicate repetitions).\r\n\r\nThe trick would then be to generate a serializer-friendly triple-stream . This part could be implemented by extension-traits around Graph/Dataset (and as such, could not easily be integrated in Rio).",

The current plan is to split `sophia` into a core API and crates implementing the provided interface (see #23 , #26 ). In addition, the implementation of a Turtle serializer (and related formats) will probably require several days (weeks, months...) of investment. Therefore, I'm not that into the idea doing all the work as one big (or several minor) PR. Accordingly, I'll setup my own project following the philosophy of #23 .

    "body": "Hi, thanks for your interest in `sophia`.\r\n\r\nThanks also for spotting this bug (`namespace!` not being usable outside `sophia`). It made me realize a deeper issue about exposing this macro: it is conceptually unsafe. More precisely, it statically builds Iris, without any check that they are valid. I prefer to keep it that way to avoid an overhead caused by the `ns` submodules, but that should be documented.\r\n\r\nThe solution to your problem (that does not involve publicly exposing `IriData` fields) would be to create a new constructor `pub const unsafe IriData::from_raw_parts`, and call this constructor in `ns_tem!` instead of setting the fields directly.\r\n\r\n> btw, I am a neophyte Rust programmer\r\n\r\nI've been there not so long ago, and honestly, I still have much to learn ;-) Welcome onboard.\r\n",

    "body": "My intention is to seperate handling of the single RDF-terms (IRI, blank node, literal, variable) from an RDF-term that can be anything. In my opinion this makes it **easier to reason** about how a certain type of term is handled.\r\n\r\nLet me explain it for serialization. Assume a trait for serializing something conformant to NTriples:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait NtSerializable {\r\n    fn seriallize<W: io::Write>(&self, w: &mut W) -> io::Result<()>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be implemented for basic types like `IriData`, `BNodeId`, ... then serializing a `Term` would just be (simplyfied):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl NtSerializable for Term {\r\n    fn serialize<W: io::Write>(&self, w: &mut W) -> io::Result<()> {\r\n        match self {\r\n            Iri(iri) => iri.serialize(w),\r\n            Literal(literal) => literal.serialize(w),\r\n            ...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nContinuing this up to `Graph` or `Database` (maybe with specialized traits for strict and so on). As a user it enables me to **precisely find the code** how different elements of RDF are serialized.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnother point I want to make is **uniformity**. As the same is already done for IRIs and blank nodes I thought it would just be consequent to do the same for literals (and maybe variables). Especially, as blank nodes are less complex as literals but already have an own type.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn a broader scale the seperation of `Literal`s also supports a higher idea of mine. Actually, I wanted to come up with this later. The idea is to **make `Term` a trait**. Yes, this probably adds  a lot more of generics, where-clauses and verbosity. But I think this only appies to the library side. \r\n\r\nApplications will pick probably only a bunch of concrete crates from the `sophia` ecosystem. Therefore, they will not need to handle complex where-clauses.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand this would allow us to support external term implementations with existing sophia code, For example, use rio's terms directly in `sophia::HashGraph` without the need for conversion. Another example is to handle strict and generalized RDF by different implementations of `Term` reusing the base types for IRIs, blank nodes and literals.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, extensions of the RDF-standard could easily interoperate with the `sophia` ecosystem. In fact, I'm thinking of Notation 3 here. In order to support quoted graphs in triples it is essential to support another kind of `Term`.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not the topic of this PR and should prabably be moved into an own issue.",

    "body": "Ok, that is clearer, thanks.\r\n\r\nIn the current design, I thought of the `Term`enum as a sort of \"class hierarchy\", where the enum itself is the superclass, and the variants (`Iri`, `Literal`, etc...) *are* the subclasses. The \"inner types\" (such as `IriData` and `BNodeId`) were mere artifacts, introduced to overcome the limitations on enum variants (they can not have private attributes or methods of their own).\r\n\r\nAs I understand, you propose an approach where each subclass is defined as a separate type, and variants of the superclass enum are mere wrappers. I agree this is more regular, probably easier to understand, and possibly more idiomatic (see for example https://docs.rs/json/0.12.1/json/enum.JsonValue.html).\r\n\r\nIf we go that way, though, I would prefer:\r\n\r\n* to name the subclass types as closely as possible to their variant (so renaming `IriData` to `Iri`, and so on), and have them defined in respective submodules (`term::iri`, `term::litral`, etc.);\r\n\r\n* to make `Literal` itself an enum, with variants `Typed{value: T, datatype: T}, Lang{value: T, tag: T}` and get rid of `LiteralKind`, because I find that the currently proposed design makes pattern matching on literals way too verbose...\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAs for turning `Term` into a trait, this is indeed a totally different topic.

    "body": "In a subcomment above, I promised another proposal, and I meant it, but actually I came back to my original design :-/. Let my try to explain how.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the parser library works like that:\r\n``` rust\r\n// create a Parser -- this is not specified by the Parser trait\r\nlet p = TurtleParser::new().with_default_prefixes(&prefix_map);\r\n// use it to parse file f1 in graph g1\r\np.parse(f1).in_graph(&mut g1);\r\n// alternatively, use the triple stream API to parse file f2 in graph g2\r\nlet parsed_triples = p.parse(f2); // returns a TripleSource\r\ng2.insert_all(parsed_triples);\r\n```\r\nI find this API intuitive, and easy to read and write.\r\n\r\nIf we try to imagine a perfectly symmetrical API for serializers, it would look like\r\n```rust\r\n// create a Serializer -- this is not specified by the Serializer trait\r\nlet s = TurtleSerializer::new().with_prefixes(&prefix_map);\r\n// use it to serializer graph g1 in file f1\r\ns.serialize_graph(&g1).in_(f1);\r\n// alternatively, use the triple stream API to serialize graph g2 in file f2\r\nlet turtle_file = s.sink(f2); // returns a TripleSink\r\ng2.triples().in_sink(turtle_file);\r\n```\r\nThis looks (IMO) equally nice to the Parser example,\r\nbut it raises the question of what the `serialize_graph` method returns,\r\nand furthermore what would be the use of the returned object,\r\n*except* for calling its \"in_\" method (granted, the name is not good, but that's not the point here).\r\nSo I came to the conclusion that this intermediate object should probably not exist,\r\nand I came back to the original design.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// create a Serializer -- this is not specified by the Serializer trait\r\nlet s = TurtleSerializer::new().with_prefixes(&prefix_map);\r\n// use it to serializer graph g1 in file f1\r\ns.serialize_graph_in(&g1, f1);\r\n// alternatively, use the triple stream API to serialize graph g2 in file f2\r\nlet turtle_file = s.sink(f2); // returns a TripleSink\r\ng2.triples().in_sink(turtle_file);\r\n```\r\nDoes it make more sense?",

The serializer trait you suggest is perfectly aligned to the source/sink model you follow.\r\n\r\nI think of a different model for serializers. For me a serializer's purpose is to serialize data to _one_ target. I agree that this means there a two steps for initialization. First create some configuration that you may be able to share across threads and so on. The difference in my thinking is that the concrete serializer is initialized with that config and a target, so the one serializer is owning it one target. Throughout the life of the serializer I can add one or more graphs, triples and so on. Eventually, the serializer is consumed and the target is returned (therefore `fn finish(self) -> Result<Self::Outcome>`).\r\n\r\n> and furthermore what would be the use of the returned object,\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggested to return `Result<()>` until serialization is `finish()`ed nothing is returned but errors are reported.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I prefer sharing a config and built serializers on demand, e.g. per thread.

I suggest to solve this problem by consulting the [RDF spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#rdf-documents):\r\n\r\n> An RDF document is a document that encodes an RDF graph or RDF dataset in a concrete RDF syntax, [...].\r\n\r\nConsequently, the serialization of an `Graph` would also finalize the serialization process - for a triple serializer, as you proposed.

The second takes one complete `Graph` and finishes immedeatly. Where the streaming quads version should also be able to take `Graph`s.\r\n\r\nTo sum up:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait TripleSerializer {\r\n    type Outcome;\r\n    type Error: std::error::Error;\r\n\r\n    fn serialize<TS: TripleSource>(&mut self, ts: TS)\r\n        -> Result<(), StreamError<TS::Error, Self::Error>>;\r\n    fn finish(self) -> Result<Self::Outcome, Self::Error>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait GraphSerializer {\r\n    type Outcome;\r\n    type Error: std::error::Error;\r\n\r\n    fn serialize<G: Graph>(self, g: &G)\r\n        -> Result<Self::Outcome, StreamError<G::Error, Self::Error>>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait QuadSerializer {\r\n    type Outcome;\r\n    type Error: std::error::Error;\r\n\r\n    fn serialize_stream<QS: QuadSource>(&mut self, qs: QS)\r\n        -> Result<(), StreamError<QS::Error, Self::Error>>;\r\n    fn serialize_graph<G: Graph>(&mut self, g: &G, name: Option<&Term>) \r\n        -> Result<(), StreamError<G::Error, Self::Error>>;\r\n    fn finish(self) -> Result<Self::Outcome, Self::Error>;\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait DatasetSerializer {\r\n    type Outcome;\r\n    type Error: std::error::Error;\r\n\r\n    fn serialize<D: Dataset>(self, d: &D) \r\n        -> Result<Self::Outcome, StreamError<D::Error, Self::Error>>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Thanks a lot for your critical eye, and for challenging me into improving the design of Sophia :-)\r\n\r\nYour welcome.

    "body": "> Note that I didn't follow your latest suggestion to have separate traits for serializing sources and serializing graphs. I would rather leave it to implementors to decide what they allow and what they disallow. \r\n\r\nOkay you are right. It is okay to handle this by throwing an error if a second graph shouldn't be serialized.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> For the sake of symmetry with the parser API, ...\r\n\r\nI can understand that you stick to the 'serializer + sink' pattern to be symmetric with the parser. But in my view parsing and serialization are two inherent different things. Therefore, symmetry is not a valid design factor for the serializer API for me. On the first glance both parsing and serializing are symmetric. \"Go from document to data\" and \"go from data to document\". However, this is already the point where similarity ends. My statement can be proven by simply parsing a document and immediatly serialize it again. I'm pretty sure that for any set of parser and serializer the output will not be the _exact_ same as the input despite being correct (as long as the input does not come from the serializer itself).\r\n\r\nOn an implementation level, the parser is right in supporting a lazy evaluation, i.e. an `Iterator` API, as we might only want to check if a certain triple is contained or we want to only parser a certain set of triples. Here the `Iterator` can help us to stop early and save resources. On the other hand, when we are serializing data we are in control of it already, only giving the triples to the serializer we want to. This means that a serializer will consume a `TripleSource` at once.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I advocate to break the symmetrie of parser and serializer. For me the `TripleSerializingSink` is all the API we need for a serializer in a core-crate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBTW the insymmetry of parsing and serializing is an example why I'm not a fan of the `Sink`-trait in general. It adds complexity where it don't have to be. For example, the `Inserter` and `Remover` sinks could be removed by implementing the same thing directly in `Graph`'s methods. Maybe a more convincing point is that there is no special sink type in Rust I can think of no example neither in the std-lib nor in any popular crate I can think of. Of course I will change my mind if you bring any counterevidence.",

    "body": "From your comments above, I gather that my explanation (in the `tripe::stream` module) of why we need `TripleSource` is not clear enough. But thanks for your question about `collect`, that's a perfect example of the (too) strong assumption that `Iterator` makes on its items.\r\n\r\nHere is a proposal to replace (or complement) the current doc in `triple::stream`. Is it clearer for you?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nConsider a parser using 3 buffers to store the subject, predicate, and object of the triples it parses.\r\nEach time it extracts a triple from the data, it yields it (as 3 references to its internal buffers)\r\nthrough the `for_each_triple` method. Then, it **reuses** the buffers to store the data for the next triple,\r\nand yields the new triple, as 3 references to the *same* buffers.\r\n\r\nAn iterator can not be implemented this way, because items yielded by iterators are expected to live (at least) as long as the iterator itself. Consider for example the `collect` method of iterators, it would not work if the items were as short lived as in the example above.\r\n\r\nBecause many parsers (as well as other triple sources) will be implemented in a manner similar to that described above, we have to provide a trait with *weaker assumptions* on its items than `Iterator` has.\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be to wrap such parsers with a layer that would *copy* the data from internal buffers to fresh buffers for each triples, and we do not want to impose that cost on all implementations\r\n\u2014 especially when many consumers will be happy with short-lived references.",

    "body": "Sorry but I don't see the use case you describe. It don't makes sense to me to have short lived buffer contents. \r\n\r\nHere are the use cases (for parsers) I can imagine and roughly how I would implement them:\r\n\r\n#### Parse from `String`\r\n\r\nThe parser is implemented in a zero-copy way and gives out `RefTerm`s (`TD = &'source str`). In this case `RefTerm`s can be stored within the parser without a problem as the lifetime is tight to the `source` so the references 'content' will outlive the parsing anyway. Note that instead of `&'source str` you can always return `&'static str` as it is guaranteed to outlive `'source`. This can become handy when some shorthand like `a` or implicit datatypes are parsed in Turtle. So no need for internal, owning buffers here.\r\n\r\n#### Parse from big document\r\n\r\nLets assume that the RDF-document we parse is to big for our machine's memory. Indeed, this is an interessting case where it could be desireable to only parse one triple (NTriples) or one block (Turtle) at a time and give out references of this temporary read. Here I could think of an architecture of iterator-of-iterators. The outer-iterator reads from the document (`'doc`) units of interesst (`'doc :  'part` this means the lifetime `'part` is ensured to be shorter than `'doc` see [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.30.0/book/second-edition/ch19-02-advanced-lifetimes.html)). Those parts then are parsed individually by parsers that hand out `RefTerm<'part>`. I think this could work.\r\n\r\n#### Read from persistent data structure\r\n\r\nHere I think no parsing is needed but `Graph`s are directly constructed (e.g. HDT format). For this case you found already a very elegant solution.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs you can see in my opinion I can't figure out the problem you are facing.\r\n\r\nBTW It is not clear to me what the function `for_each_triple()` is supposed to do... something like `Iterator::for_each()`?\r\n\r\nAnd the most important question: What has this to do with sinks?",

    "body": "> Parse Strings\r\n\r\nThings are not that simple... Consider the following turtle\r\n```turtle\r\n@base <http://example.org/foo/bar/>\r\n<../BAZ> <http://schema.org/label> \"\\u2693\"; \r\n    <http://example.org/other-prop> \"\\u2744\".\r\n```\r\nThe subject of the first triple, can not reference to the inner data of the string (it must contain `http://example.org/foo/BAZ`), and neither can the object (it must contain `\u2603`). So you need internal buffers. And once the first triple has been yielded, it makes sense for the parser to reuse the internal object buffer to store the new literal.\r\n\r\n> Parse big files\r\n\r\nWhat you are suggesting is to have different APIs for parsing strings and files... This is not really convenient for the user.\r\n\r\n> What does it have to do with sinks\r\n\r\nAs I put it in the intro of that issue:  I introduced sinks to be able to consume sources, and I introduced sources because iterators had limitation. By improving the design of sources (with the `for_each_triple` method), we could make it possible to consume a source without a dedicated sink object.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, the `for_each_triple` methods is supposed to work the same way as `Iterator::for_each`. Again, sources are just iterators with weaker assumptions on their items.\r\n\r\n",

It's been a long time since the last one, and your crate could depend on a stable version rather than a github link...\r\n\r\nRegarding `match_ns`, that's a good idea, with the following changes:\r\n* why not simply accept `&str` for the `ns` parameter?\r\n* I'm guessing you meant `char` and not `Char`\r\n* Why return an iterator of `&'a char`? Why not simply `char`?\r\n* It would make more sense to me to return the *right* chars, i.e. those usable to make the suffix\r\n  (but maybe that's what you meant).\r\n",

    "body": "> This looks awesome now I understand what you are talking about. \r\n\r\nThanks :-)\r\n\r\n> However, it could be hard but a `next_triple()` method would be nice.\r\n\r\nYeah, I though about it... It could look like that:\r\n```rust\r\n    fn next_triple<'s>(&'s mut self) -> StreamedTriple<'s, Self::Triple>;\r\n```\r\nand the bound on lifetime `'s` would prevent to call `next_triple` again while the returned streamed triple is alive (as this would cause two mutable borrows on self).\r\n\r\nBut... I can not implement this method for Rio parsers, so I ruled it out -- with regrets :cry: \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is a shame do make an API design decision based on one particular implementation. But on the other hand, the UnsafeTriple / StreamedTriple pattern (which is required to make the `next_triple` method possible) is a quite complex one (you know how hard it was to make it right... you were there :wink:), so we can't expect all implementatiosn to have a similar mechanism.  Hence my decision.\r\n\r\nOf course, when Rust finally supports GAT, things will be much easier :smile:",

The reason for not consuming them is that some sources (especially parsers) may still carry valuable information after they have exhausted their triples (e.g. the prefix declaration they have encountered). See #45 for a discussion on that topic.\r\n\r\nWould you mind making a new PR with only the last two items, and wait till we resolve #45 for the first one? Thanks",

    "body": "I don't know if such information is that valuable. For me the task of a parser is to read and interpret the contents of an RDF document. Therefore, it should return only absolute IRIs, resolving prefixes and base IRI. Accordingly, the information someone could get from a parser should already be included in the triples returned.\r\n\r\nAs a special case, retrieving the base IRI from a Turtle document (or other Notation3 derived format) can be ... dangerous. As stated in [RDF 1.1 chapter 6.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/#sec-iri-references)\r\n\r\n> [...] Each @base or BASE directive sets a new In-Scope Base URI, relative to the previous one. \r\n\r\nSo there can be an unlimited number of `@base` directives in a Turtle document, doing some fun stuff like:\r\n\r\n```turtle\r\n# This is valid Turtle\r\n@base <http://example.com/fun/stuff/> .\r\n<Peter> a <../Human> .\r\n\r\n@base <../> .\r\n<Human> <#hasEntity> <stuff/Peter> .\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo what base IRI should be returned?\r\n\r\nOf course I see that there are possibilities where it can be beneficial to yield such informations and not to convert IRIs immediately but I think those are very optimized and in such cases parsers should return an own type of `Graph` rather than implementing the streaming interface.

The second option induces that effort only on those implementors who want to support collect_graph/collect_dataset, but users may in turn be surprised if not all Graph/Dataset implementations support that. I'm still not sure which one I prefer.",

Recall that Sophia aims to support a [generalized model](https://docs.rs/sophia/0.3.0/sophia/#generalized-vs-strict-rdf-model). In particular, any term is allowed in any position of Triples/Quads.\r\n\r\n> Replace Option<&Term> for graph names with [a dedicated enum]\r\n\r\nYour proposed enum is incorrect w.r.t. the RDF Abstract Model, which allows IRIs **or blank nodes** as graph names. Furthermore, as mentioned above, I'd like to keep the Sophia generalized model as uniform as possible. Literal as graph names are very debatable, but variables as graph names will be useful when we want to represent queries as generalized datasets.\r\n\r\nAn orthogonal concern is: should we have a dedicated type for graph names, instead of simply using `Option<Term>`? I previously used a dedicated type, and I found it caused much complexity without having real added value. Furthermore, I think the semantics of the graph name in a quad is accurately conveyed by `Option<Term>`: triples from the default graph have *no* associated graph name, while triples from named graphs have *some* associated graph name, which is a term.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not really favorable to that last item.

    "body": "Concerning #23 I get the feeling that this topic is to much detail for a common API.\r\nAs this topic is pretty specific to Turtle, e.g. NTriples have no prefixes and Json-LD has its `\"@context\"`, and targets a \"majority of simple cases\".\r\n\r\nYou said yourself in another issue that you like to keep `sophia` as general as applicable which I totally agree with. Therefore, I would suggest to leave this question open for implementers of Turtle parsers. In addition, this would increase the incompatibility with `rio`'s parser.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBTW [`metis`](https://github.com/MattesWhite/metis-rs/tree/master/metis/src/parse) now also includes a Turtle parser. I programmed it as an intermediate step towards an Notation3 parser (which I started but not works, yet). It is still WIP and has many rough edges but parses at least most documents. For now it is not aligned with `sophia`'s parser API, yet. But I plan to do so in the future. Maybe you can use it as an additional inspiration for \"RDF in Rust\".\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> In the last commit I added a `resolve_triples()` method to `TripleSource`\r\n\r\nAs [previously stated](https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs/pull/49#issuecomment-593436346), I have mixed feelings about this.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, I can see that this is a rather general-purpose method on triple/quad stream, that may deserves a dedicated method.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, if we go down that path, there are many other general-purposes functions that I can think of that would equally deserve their own specific method:\r\n\r\n* rename bnodes into fresh ones\r\n* replace bnodes with variables / variables with bnodes\r\n* change absolute IRIs to relative ones (given a base IRI) (opposite of resolve)\r\n* replace variables by their bound values (given a mapping)\r\n\r\nWe would end up with a rather cluttered API, while all of this can be achieved rather simply with `map_triples`. In the case of `resolve_triples`, this would be\r\n```rust\r\n   source.map_triples(|t| base.resolve(t))\r\n```",

    "body": "You're right `resolve_triples()` is more or less a convenient method for `map_triples()`. And especially as it is a convenience I'd like keeping it. Besides the constraints of `Iterator`s they have a pretty rich API. And you get all of it by simply implementing `next()`. Of course most `Iterator` methods can be implemented by `map()` and `fold()` as well. Triple-/QuadSource can be the same where you get a rich API of convenience methods for free.\r\n\r\nAnother point is discoverability. With many convenient methods someone can directly see the features `sophia` provides. Whereas, you have to figure out yourself how the parts fit together when there are only a few methods.",

    "body": "I'm happy with this PR, **except** for the `IntoIter` impl for `Resolver` (see my comment on the code). Actually, I think that the `resolve_triples`/`Resolver` thing be treated separately. In particular, I came to the conclusion that `TripleSource::resolve_triples` should be implemented as follow:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n    fn resolve_triples<'a>(self, base: IriParsed<'a>) -> MapSource<Self, XXX>\r\n    where /* ... */\r\n    {\r\n        self.map_triples(move |t| base.resolve(t))\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis way, we would inherit all the `impl`s attached to `MapSource`, including `IntoIter`.\r\n\r\nThe only problem is the `XXX` in the return type of the method; we need to put there the exact type of the closure, which is not possible :-/ But I can see a solution to this: make `MapSource` more generic: instead of expecting a `FnMut(StreamedTriple<S::Triple>) -> T`, it would expect a trait `SourceMapper<S>`, which would be implemented by `FnMut(StreamedTriple<S::Triple>) -> T`, but also other types...\r\n\r\nI suggest we get rid of all the parts of this PR that relate to `resolve_triple` and the `Resolver` type. This will be added in the future PR addressing #52. Ideally, this would be done by cherry-picking the relevant commits and submitting a clean branch. But if that's too much hassle, and you prefer to just remove all this with an additional commit, I'll understand.",

    "body": "> Merge the stream submodules into a top-level module stream equal to triple and quad.\r\n\r\nI started trying this out, factorizing some of the code into a `StatementSource` trait, then defining specializations of it as `TripleSource` and `QuadSource`. But I ran into the following problem:\r\n\r\nOne can not easily use the specialized traits in a trait bound. Instead of writing\r\n```rust\r\n        pub fn consume_triple_source<TS: TripleSource>(mut ts: TS) \r\n        { /*...*/ }\r\n````\r\none needs to write\r\n```rust\r\n        pub fn consume_triple_source<TS: TripleSource>(mut ts: TS) \r\n        where <TS::Mode as StreamingMode>::Item: UnsafeTriple\r\n        { /*...*/ }\r\n````\r\nwhich is unintuitive and cumbersome. This does not go in the direction of making the API easier...\r\n\r\nI put [a summarized version of this problem](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=cb7ee5fdcb52bfff47d8f143ac7fd461) in the playground.\r\n",

    "body": "@dwhitney that would awesome...  :-)\r\n\r\nSophia has evolved quite a bit in the meantime, in order to be more usable as a common API for RDF in Rust. @Tpt and I have agreed (in a discussion offline) that a good way forward would be to extract oxigraph's SPARQL parser and AST into a separate crate, using sophia's `Term` type as a building block.\r\n\r\nFYI, the `Term` type is currently being refactored (#47, #48, #49). Once this is finished (Literals still need to be done), I plan to extract it into a separate crate `sophia_term`, so that crates using it, such as this new SPARQL crate, would not end up importing the whole of sophia.",

    "body": "I'm waiting to see your POC, but I'm not sure exactly what benefit you would gain from such a trait, especially if Iri, Literal and BlankNode are still constrained to be concrete types...\r\n\r\nNote that nothing forces implementations of Sophia's traits (Graph, Dataset, Parser, Serializer...) to use Term internally. For example, Rio parsers do not, but still interoperate with Sophia. All that is required is to provide easy ways to convert internal \"terms\" to and from Sophia's Term.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, thanks to the TermData parameter, Term is already rather flexible:\r\n\r\n* `Term<&str>` aka `RefTerm` can be cheaply constructed whenever `str` data is already available;\r\n* self-owning variants, such as `Term<Box<tr>>` or `Term<Rc<str>>` (aka `BoxTerm` and `RcTerm` respectively) can be used in other cases;\r\n* maybe we should also give more visibility to `Term<Cow<str>>`, giving it a type alias of its own (`CowTerm`), as it provides a nice trade-off between the two options above.\r\n\r\nThat being said, as I wrote, I'm curious to see your POC, and I remain open to discussion on this issue.",

    "body": "I see where this comes from; a student of mine also had a dependency problem when he pulled the commit splitting sophia in two distinct crates. However, I don't think this PR is the correct way to solve it.\r\n\r\nFirst: I don't know how the `path` hack in `sophia/Cargo.toml` will behave once published on crates.io, but I'm guessing not very well.\r\n\r\nSecond: I wish to keep the version numbers of all sophia crates aligned, (at least on the first two components). This will make maintenance much easier (even though it might seem strange for sophia-term to begin its life at version 0.4.0... :wink:)\r\n\r\nThe clean solution to your problem, I think, is to add the following section to *your* `Cargo.toml`:\r\n```toml\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\nsophia-term = { git = 'https://github.com/pchampin/sophia_rs' }\r\n```\r\nThis instuct cargo to look for sophia-term in the git repo, whoever asks for it (including sophia itself).\r\n\r\nWe found this solution here:\r\nhttps://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html\r\n\r\nDoes this solve your problem?",

In order to use the newest version of `sophia` in `metis` I'll add the patch-section to my `Cargo.toml`. However, the `path` should also be added to `sophia/Cargo.toml`. It allows you to work with the [local version](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#multiple-locations) of `sophia_term`during development once the (sub-)crate is published.\r\n\r\nRegarding the version of `sophia_term` I thought this might be a copy'n'paste error. As this is intentional I will not argue about versioning.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, you can either close this PR or I'll remove the changes at `term/Cargo.toml` in an additional commit and you can squash the commits.",

Doing otherwise would break the user's expectation about what `map` does (in any other type, this is the main purpose of `map` after all). Granted, modifying the string is more hazardous here, since the function does not know the *context* of the string (is it a ns? a suffix? the value of a literal?...). But I still think this sould be allowed.\r\n*  I think we could then simply get rid of `clone_with`, which essentially does the same thing -- or maybe rename it to `map_str`, for the sake of regularity.\r\n",

I don't think I agree with your premise \"`Namespace` was practically another Iri-type\":\r\n\r\n* a `Namespace` is neither an IRI nor a Term (you can not use it in a triple or a quad). If anything, it relates more to `TermFactory`;\r\n\r\n* not any `Iri` can be used as a `Namespace` -- as your comment above points out, the correct behavior of `with_suffix` is not entirely trivial with \"suffixed\" IRIs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, `schema.get(\"Person\")` looks much nicer, I think, than `Term::from(schema.with_suffix(\"Person\"))`.\r\n\r\nI could see the value of providing `From` conversion from `Iri` to `Namespace`, and possibly a `get_iri` method in `Namespace`, in addition to `get`... But as for replacing `Namespace` with `Iri` entirely... not convinced yet, sorry.",

    "body": "Okay naming `Namespace` another IRI-type were maybe not the best words. In fact, some transitions between `Namespace` and `Iri` might be more reasonable.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet var = Term::from(schema.with_suffix(\"Person\")?);\r\n// maybe better looking\r\nlet var: Term<_> = schema.with_suffix(\"Person\")?.into();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe thing is I would really like to return `Iri` instead of `Term`. The reason is re-usability. Of course we could do a `.try_into()` if we need an IRI but this would introduce another error-handling.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**To give some context:**\r\n\r\nI'm currently updating `metis` to the current state of `sophia`. This will also be the PoC of how a `Term`-trait could benefit `sophia` (see #55). I planned to use `Namespace` for the prefixes. However, after parsing a prefix's IRI it must be resolved against the current base IRI. Meaning (I) parse the IRI, (II) resolve the `Iri`  and finally (III) convert `Iri` to `Namespace`. Hence, the PR. Maybe a `impl Resolve<Namespace> for IriParsed` could also help :thinking:.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I could reuse the prefix-parser from Turtle for N3. Which means that I would like to return an `Iri` as Turtle and N3 use different _terms_ which both implement `From<Iri>`. In fact, my N3Term looks something like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nenum N3Term<TD> {\r\n    Iri(Iri<TD>),\r\n    Literal(Literal<TD>),\r\n    Existential(BlankNode<TD>),\r\n    Universal(Variable<TD>),\r\n    Formula(Formula<TD>), // some kind of `Graph<N3Term>`\r\n    List(Vec<N3Term<TD>>),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see I would like to reuse a `Graph` implementation of `sophia` which I can't do because it's fixed to `sophia_term::Term`.",

In fact, my N3Term looks something like:\r\n> \r\n> ```rust\r\n> enum N3Term<TD> {\r\n>     Iri(Iri<TD>),\r\n>     Literal(Literal<TD>),\r\n>     Existential(BlankNode<TD>),\r\n>     Universal(Variable<TD>),\r\n>     Formula(Formula<TD>), // some kind of `Graph<N3Term>`\r\n>     List(Vec<N3Term<TD>>),\r\n> }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> As you can see I would like to reuse a `Graph` implementation of `sophia` which I can't do because it's fixed to `sophia_term::Term`.\r\n\r\nThanks, this helps me understand the benefit you expect from a `Term` trait.\r\n\r\nI had already given some thoughts (although not as much as you) to N3 and Sophia, and my idea was that N3 *could* be encoded in the generalized model provided by Sophia. Namely:\r\n\r\n* lists are represented by a chain of blank nodes,\r\n* formulae are represented by named graphs (with blank nodes as names).\r\n\r\nSo rather than forcing some `N3Term` type into a plain Sophia `Graph`, I would have gone for using a Sophia `Dataset` as a back-end, and wrapping it in a `N3Graph` providing a higher level API. I don't know if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nMay be you have already explored this lead and found it unfeasible or suboptimal... It is very possible that I am overlooking some problems of this approach.\r\n\r\nBut what you propose seems to extend Sophia's scope much beyond RDF. Granted, the current generalized model already extends it... but this is even much more. For example, what you suggest is that not all implementations of the `Term` trait would be entirely interoperable. If I get a triple out of an N3Graph, and that triple involved a formula, what happens when I try to insert it in another graph?\r\n",

    "body": "Granted your suggestion for a `N3Graph` could work. But you are right. Such a hacked implementation is far from what I imagine. Given the complexity we already have in returning triples, further abstraction don't make things better. All in all, I think I should be satisfied with the possibility to re-use `sophia`'s `Term` and its subtypes, implementing N3 on top is still a huge amount of work. However, I'm convinced that an N3-engine in Rust could out-perform existing N3-engines by orders of magnitudes if we look at `cwm` (Python), `ldfu` (Java) and EYE (Prolog).\r\n\r\nIn summary I'll close this issue as this (as you mentioned) exceeds the intended implementation of RDF to far.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Problems with `Dataset` as `N3Graph`**\r\n\r\nA short list of problems of your suggestion for the record:\r\n\r\n- Lists are a first class datatype in N3. The `rdf:first`/`rdf:rest` implementation in RDF is rather a reification of N3-lists. Therefore, it makes sense to handle lists as some kind of N3-Term.  \r\n- Lists are frequently used and manipulated in built-in functional predicates each time traversing the formula would probably be very expensive.\r\n- Each time resolving if a blank node is a formula-expression or simply a blank node should be expensive as well.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above, I imagine a performance optimized N3-engine. Accordingly, an optimized implementation of a `Formula` is more practical than re-using `sophia`'s `Graph`s or `Dataset`s.",

Furthermore, the primary goal of `TermFactory` is to *avoid* allocations, and reuse an existing `TermData` instead, so I'm not sure about the ROI if such optimization...\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "If I understand trait objects correctly, `&dyn TermTrait` is *not* a direct reference to your, say, `RcTerm`, but a reference to an object, automatically created by the compiler, that contains a pointer to your `RcTerm` as well as a table of pointers to its methods (the equivalent of C++'s [virtual table](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/125-the-virtual-table/)). My guess is that creating this trait object is at least as expensive as creating a `RefTerm`...\r\n\r\nBut yes, we could consider simplifying the API, and requiring `RefTerm`s everywhere the current API accepts `Term<T>` for any `T`. Note however, that with the current approach, developers have a choice: reduce compile time and image size by *only* calling `Graph` methods with `RefTerm`s, or reduce execution time by passing whatever term they have at hand, and relying on monorphization. In any case, thorough testing of different options is the only way to know which is the best.\r\n\r\n> In addition, it may make sense to move `Graph`'s filter-methods to `TripleSource`\r\n\r\nThis is already the case. Any iterator of `Result<Triple, _>` is a `TripleSource`.

    "body": "Okay I agree with you the use of `RefTerm` mitigates the usage of a trait-object `&dyn TermTrait`. In fact, I tried a little bit around to implement a `TermTrait` that hasn't a `<TD>` type parameter which is necessary to avoid monomorphization. If it should be usable it requires to be comparable to at leas some kind of `&Term<TD>` and I didn't find a way of doing it with returning a `RefTerm` :roll_eyes: ...\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> If I understand trait objects correctly, `&dyn TermTrait` is _not_ a direct reference ...\r\n\r\nWell, your understanding is mostly true. `&dyn Trait` is a so-called fat pointer that, as you stated correctly, contains two pointers: The first points to the data passed in and the second points to the datatype's `vtable`. All in all, the creation of a trait object only requires taking a pointer to the data and the `vtable`-pointer is probably already defined at compile time which means creating a trait object has nearly the same cost as taking a _single_ normal reference where a `RefTerm` allocates a whole new `Term` (see size-table below). The real cost of a trait object is that it's methods can no longer be inlined by the compiler, probably resulting in less efficient/optimized code.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is better to show the impact of an trait object when we look at the size of different `Term`s:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Results of std::mem::size_of<${type}>():\r\nSize of RefTerm:       72\r\nSize of Term<String>:  96\r\nSize of BoxTerm:       72\r\nSize of MownTerm:      96\r\nSize of RcTerm:        72\r\nSize of ArcTerm:       72\r\nSize of &dyn Error:    16\r\n-------------------------\r\nSize of Term<&str>:    72\r\nSize of Literal<&str>: 64\r\nSize of Iri<&str>:     40\r\nSize of &str:          16\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see on my 64bit machine each `RefTerm` requires the allocation of 72 additional bytes of the stack (9 words!) while a trait object always only has a size of 16 bytes, i.e. 2 words.",

I stand corrected, then.\r\n\r\nThe point your raise about the size of `Term` in general is valid. One question that I still have is: is it worth it two have IRIs split in ns+suffix? How much time and space does it save, compared to the burden of carrying fat `Term`s around? Unfortunately, investigating this would be very time consuming... This would be easier if `Term` was a trait, though :-D\r\n\r\nRegarding monoporphization of `Graph`/`Dataset` methods, it looks as a different (although related) issue to me. Would you mind posting a new issue on that particular subject?",

    "body": "My 2 cents:\r\n\r\n### Regarding - Pro - less memory consumption in `Graphs`\r\n\r\nThere is one tricky thing about using prefixes in `Graph`s. There is no unique prefix/suffix from a given IRI. For example, if we consider the IRI `http://example.com/foo#barbaz` if is perfectly valid in Turtle to define `@prefix bar: <http://example.com/foo#bar>` and `@prefix foo: <http://example.com/foo#>` and then use `bar:baz` or `foo:barbaz` for the same IRI. Because of that `Graph`s have to apply prefixes normalization, a process that has a cost. So, I am not sure if handling prefixes in `Graph`s does actually bring something compared to only storing absolute IRIs and use delta compression or tries to save space.",

If one wants to use ns/suffix split to *optimize* memory consumption, then a form a normalization is required. But that's not a requirement in sophia, this split was introduced as an *opportunistic* optimization: whenever we construct IRIs having the same prefix (either by parsing them from Curies, or building them from a `Namespace` object), we do not *have* to duplicate the ns data.\r\n\r\n> only storing absolute IRIs and use delta compression\r\n\r\nBut then you have to decompress the data whenever you want to return a reference to it...

    "body": "First of all big respect for this major refactoring of the whole crate :clap: . I see the huge amount of work that has gone into it :+1: and the trait really integrates well.\r\n\r\nBut with such a large change there are some points I'd like to address which could further improve `sophia`.\r\n\r\n### `str_absolute()`\r\n\r\nThis function currently returns `i8` I'd like to suggest to use a dedicated `enum`. It shouldn't add overhead and makes the code more readable.\r\n\r\n### `term_*()` functions\r\n\r\nYou introduced several `term_*()` functions to provide generic default implementations for several standard traits, e.g. `Display`, `PartialCmp` and so on. \r\n\r\nTo make better use of Rust's type system I propose to introduce a dedicated type for these implementations:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct GenericTermImpl<T: TTerm + ?Sized>(T);\r\n\r\n// with\r\nimpl<T> Deref for GenericTermImpl<T> {\r\n    type Target = T;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// and \r\nimpl<T> From<T> for GenericTermImpl<T> {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis new-type clearly shows when a generic implementation is used and that implementors have the opportunity to write optimized implementations for their own types. In addition, this wrapper monomorphizes to nothing so it doesn't add overhead.\r\n\r\n### raw value\r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of `raw_*()` functions. I think there could be better documentation and more readable code by introducing a dedicated type:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct RawValue<'a>(pub &'a str, pub Option<&'a str>);\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'd gladly submit PRs for my proposals if you like. However, with ESWC approaching I have only a limited capacity currently.",

    "body": "> It seems to work and parse much quicker,\r\n\r\ngood\r\n\r\n> but it's not a drop in replacement in my code.\r\n\r\nnot quite, you are right...\r\n\r\n> Apologies, I find the API rather confusing! I'd be grateful for any hints.\r\n\r\nI should be the one to apologize... I'm sorry you feel that way about the API, and I am open to any suggestion to make it easier.\r\n\r\nNow about your problem:\r\n\r\n## TL/DR\r\nThis should work for you:\r\n```rust\r\n    let triple_source = sophia::parser::xml2::parse_bufread(bufread);\r\n    let triple_result: Result<Vec<[BoxTerm;3]>, _> = triple_source.collect_triples();\r\n    let triple_v = triple_result.unwrap();\r\n```\r\n## Explanations\r\n\r\n* First, you need to understand that `xml::parse_bufread(b)` is just a shortcut for `xml::RdfXmlParser::default()::parse(b)`, where [`RdfXmlParser`] implements the [`TripleParser`] trait. So basically, `xml::parse_bufread` is specified as the trait method [`TriplelParser::parse`] (and this should be true of the `parse_bufread` method of any parser module).\r\n\r\n* The contract of this method is to return a [`TripleSource`], which itself is a trait. This trait is implemented by any *iterator* of triples, but has other implementations. Each parser provides its own implementation of [`TripleSource`]. `xml`'s happens to be an iterator, and your code above was relying on that. `xml2`, on the other hand, has a different implementation (which contributes to making it faster, by the way :wink:).\r\n\r\n* Since sophia 0.5.0, [`TripleSource`] provides a method similar to Iterator's `collect`. It is called [`collect_triples`], and can build most implementations of [`Graph`] (to be precise: it can build any implementation of [`CollectibleGraph`]).\r\n\r\n* `Vec<[BoxTerm;3]>` happens to implement [`Graph`] and [`CollectibleGraph`].\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\n[`RdfXmlParser`]: https://docs.rs/sophia/0.5.3/sophia/parser/xml/struct.RdfXmlParser.html\r\n[`TripleParser`]: https://docs.rs/sophia/0.5.3/sophia/parser/trait.TripleParser.html\r\n[`TriplelParser::parse`]: https://docs.rs/sophia/0.5.3/sophia/parser/trait.TripleParser.html#tymethod.parse\r\n[`TripleSource`]: https://docs.rs/sophia/0.5.3/sophia/triple/stream/trait.TripleSource.html\r\n[`collect_triples`]: https://docs.rs/sophia/0.5.3/sophia/triple/stream/trait.TripleSource.html?search=#method.collect_triples\r\n[`Graph`]: https://docs.rs/sophia/0.5.3/sophia/graph/trait.Graph.html\r\n[`CollectibleGraph`]: https://docs.rs/sophia/0.5.3/sophia/graph/trait.CollectibleGraph.html",

Especially when implemented though traits, the documentation you need in the Rust doc can be several clicks away or deep in the page. Main thing that would help would be a bit more module documentation and especially examples!\r\n\r\nI need to think more on sophia, because at the moment my own https://github.com/phillord/horned-owl duplicates some of the functionality.

For building up an RDF-graph `sophia` is totally suited and has many convenient things to do so, e.g. [`namespace!()`](https://docs.rs/sophia_api/0.6.1/sophia_api/macro.namespace.html) to declare your vocabulary inside Rust code.\r\n\r\nAs far as JSON-LD support goes, you might have seen the [`sophia_jsonld`](https://crates.io/crates/sophia_jsonld) crate. It might not be very mature as it can only serialize expanded JSON-LD at the moment but it is a good point to start. In the end, the _only_ missing thing for from the RDF-side of your project is to implement a proper JSON-LD compaction algorithm to have a nice serialization.\r\n\r\nThere are other crates about JSON-LD (https://crates.io/search?q=json-ld, https://lib.rs/search?q=json-ld), however, none of them is as well maintained as `sophia` and most are only concerned with JSON-LD directly and do not cover the RDF part.",

    "body": "@brycefisher nice project, I'm looking forward to trying that!\r\n\r\n@MattesWhite summed it up pretty well. You can either construct an RDF graph using [the implementations provided by Sophia](https://docs.rs/sophia/0.6.1/sophia/graph/inmem/index.html), or maybe have your own types implement the [Graph trait](https://docs.rs/sophia_api/0.6.1/sophia_api/graph/trait.Graph.html) to avoid duplicating information.\r\n\r\nThen indeed, you can generate expanded JSON-LD with the serializer provided in [`sophia_jsonld`](https://crates.io/crates/sophia_jsonld). Compacting it to a more idiomatic form is the job of [JSON-LD's compaction algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11-api/#compaction), which has no implementation in Rust for the moment, AFAIK.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have been in contact with @timothee-haudebourg, who is working on an [implementation of JSON-LD](https://github.com/timothee-haudebourg/json-ld). Hopefully I'll find some time to contribute to this one during the summer, but I guess Timoth\u00e9e can use any help he can find :wink:.",

    "body": "Hi,\r\nnice to see another one interested in contributing to `sophia`. Regarding the licencing I can't tell you much. This is the responsibility of @pchampin . \r\n\r\nReally nice that you did a benchmark on IRI crates in Rust. As you can see in #74 we are aware of this issue. Like you pointed out IRIs can have many different use cases where the focus is laid on different properties. To be able to satisfy as many applications as possible the `TTerm` trait was designed as flexible as possible. Therefore, it may be of interest for your benchmark to implement `TTerm` for the other IRI types you inspect and look at the performance and size of graphs made up of those. You may also notice that `sophia` itself already provides two different implementations of an IRI, namely `sophia::term::SimpleIri` and `sophia::term::iri::Iri`.",

    "body": "@alexkreidler thanks for your interest, and welcome on board :)\r\n\r\nRe. licensing: as a French civil servant, I feel compelled to use CeCILL, which is compatible with French law and endorsed by my administration. Also, I usually start my personal projects with a rather protective license (GPL-like or LGPL-like) as a commitment to favour open-source in general.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I agree that a more permissive license is a better way to foster adoption (and external contribution) in a project like Sophia. I had already started I that with *some* of the crates, but I just (see commit above) changed all remaining crates to [CeCILL-B](https://cecill.info/licences/Licence_CeCILL-B_V1-en.txt), a BSD-compatible variant of CeCILL.\r\n\r\nThat's a first move, but I am still open to discussion. So:\r\n\r\nQ1: Is a BSD-style licence permissive enough for you, or is there something I'm missing that makes Apache more appealing to you?\r\n\r\nQ2: Is the CeCILL variant acceptable, or would you prefer to stick to the original one?\r\n",

    "body": "I may start work on this soon. As it seems Sophia, Rio, and Oxigraph are very focused on performance, I think it may be beneficial to create two submodules of `sophia_jsonld`: one like `full` that fully implements the spec, and another `streaming` one, based on the following spec and implementations:\r\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/2020/NOTE-json-ld11-streaming-20200507/\r\nhttps://github.com/rubensworks/jsonld-streaming-serializer.js\r\nhttps://github.com/rubensworks/jsonld-streaming-parser.js\r\n\r\nI will probably look at other JSON parsers in rust to get some inspiration. I'm a little inclined to just built the system on top of an existing well-maintained JSON parser like serde's [`StreamDeserializer`](https://docs.rs/serde_json/1.0.57/serde_json/de/struct.StreamDeserializer.html). \r\nI've also always liked the Parsing Expression Grammar formalism as it makes things simple, but looking at the Rust libraries it seems they are slower than other options. Nom looks like the next-best thing. However I am a bit wary of rolling my own entire parsing system; I don't think I trust my Rust skills that much yet. As long as I stay within a tool that has documentation, I'll be able to figure things out.\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate any thoughts or feedback people had before I jump in!",

    "body": "Yes, indeed I have a requirement for something to create new RDF terms, e.g. when I turn the results of the RDF test suite into RDF itself or more generally try to do some object-triple-mapping.\r\n\r\nAnother use case is creating new blank nodes when parsing `[]` terms in Turtle. But that can be handled by a dedicated crate.\r\n\r\n### Change `TermFactory`\r\n\r\nGiven the new `TTerm` trait, it is right to go for a `Term` agnostic factory, especially agnostic of `TermData`. However, I'd rather stick with the factory pattern.\r\n\r\nThe thing with a factory is that we still have a dedicated entity. The `CreateableTerm` solution you proposed has only `static` methods (no `self` argument). This makes it quite difficult to implement the trait for a `TermCache`. In addition, the naming `CreateableTerm` would not fit that well with an `ArcTermCache`.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nDue to the need to change the current `TermFactory` trait I'd close this PR and prepare a new one with a `sophia_term::Term` agnostic factory.",

    "body": "@yever asked\r\n> A question for @pchampin is whether having nom as a dependency is acceptable.\r\n\r\nand @MattesWhite replied\r\n> The aim of `sophia` is to provide a common API for RDF in Rust (#23), therefore, it is not intended to include a parser in `sophia`.\r\n\r\nTo be more precise: the `sophia_api` crate aims to provide a common API. Other crates in the `sophia` repo are intended to provide *some* implementation of said API  (e.g. `sophia_term` provides an implementation of the trait `TTerm`) but of course the goal is to keep the ecosystem open (e.g. [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph) is now implementing that API). Finally, the `sophia` crate is gradually becoming a \"compilation\" of other crates, including `sophia_api` and `sophia_term`. Eventually, the code it contains will move into more specialized crates (`sophia_X`), and the `sophia` crate itself will only be a bunch of `pub use` from those specialized crates. \r\n\r\nNow regarding SPARQL support, the first step would be to add new traits in `sophia_api`, related to SPARQL management. Off the top my head, I imagine\r\n* a `SparqlDataset` trait (deriving from `Dataset`), providing a `prepare_query` method, returning a `SparqlQuery`;\r\n* a `SparqlQuery` trait, providing a `execute` method, returning a `SparqlResult`;\r\n* a `SparqlResult` trait, providing a number of methods for interacting with the different kinds of results SPARQL can produce (SELECT, CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE, ASK).\r\n\r\nThen one or several implementations of these traits could be provided. For [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph), this would amount to simply adapt the existing types to the traits above. But a generic implementation of `SparqlDataset`, able to resolve queries against any type implementing `Dataset`, would be nice too... This one could benefit from the nom-based parser by @mattsse.\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies things.\r\n",

I noticed that `sophia` is gradually being modularized and I like this development.\r\n\r\nI thought that the `nom`-based parser could maybe be included in the workspace (making in it an optional dependency for users of `sophia`) because it was created as a side project and not yet published into `crates.io`.\r\n\r\nI agree that creating the relevant traits for SPARQL would be a good first step that makes a lot of sense. In fact, `Oxigraph` and `nom-sparql` can be 2 integration test scenarios for these traits.\r\n\r\nI'll try to see how far I can go with implementing these traits and raise a pull request if I have something presentable.",

    "body": "> What's the long term objective in terms of compliance with the rest of the spec? (flattening, compaction, framing)\r\n\r\nMost algorithms in the spec take JSON as input and return JSON as output, so I consider them as slightly out-of-scope for Sophia (which is centered on the notion of RDF Graph). The only relevant algorithms for Sophia are therefore `toRdf` (i.e. a JSON-LD parser) and `fromRdf` (i.e. a JSON-LD serializer).\r\n\r\nThat being said, these two algorithms are not totally independant from the others:\r\n* `toRdf` explicitly relies on the expansion algorithm\r\n* `fromRdf` as described by the spec produces expanded JSON-LD, but a full-featured serializer should provide options to produce a compact JSON-LD document, according to a given context.\r\n\r\nThe way I see things:\r\n* a separate crate will implement the JSON-LD algorithms according to the JSON-LD spec (I have [this one](https://github.com/timothee-haudebourg/json-ld) in mind, I am in contact with @timothee-haudebourg);\r\n* `sophia_jsonld` will depend on this crate to provide implementations of the Sophia traits for parsers and serializer.\r\n",

This proposal makes it possible, but does not impose on implementers to do anything about it (String provides a fallback implementation for Query).\r\n\r\n@Tpt, this notion of \"prepared query\" is quite different from the one in Oxigraph, but I think they can cohabit.
